
2, var y = 1;
        if (function f(){}) {
        y += typeof f;
    }
    console.log(y);
The output of this code would be undefined.

    var k = 1;
        if (1) {
        eval(function foo(){});
        k += typeof foo;
        }
        console.log(k);
The output for the above code would be undefined.

    var k = 1;
        if (1) {
        function foo(){};
        k += typeof foo;
        }
        console.log(k); // output 1function
The output for the above code would be 1function.

    

3, The drawback of using a private method is that it is memory insufficient, only few data can be added.

4, Closures are functions that are enclosed inside another function and function that has to its own private variables.

5, function mull(a, b, c){
    return a*b*c;
}
    mull(2, 3, 4);
    mull(4, 3, 4);
    
The mull returns the multiplication of the arguements that have been passed in another function.

6, To empty an array in javascript, there are four methods. For example, in the array below;
    var arrayList = ['a','b','c','d','e','f'];
The first is: arraylist=[ ];
Another is: arrayList.length = 0;
Yet another is : arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length);
ANd the final is : while(arrayList.length){
                        arrayList.pop();
                        }

7, To check if an object is an array or not,
    var items=['Bags', 'Belt', 'Shoe', 'Short', 'Boxers'];
    if(items === array){
    console.log(true);
    }else{
    console.log("items are not array");
    }
    
8, var output = (function(x){
    delete x;
    return x;
    })(0);
    console.log(output);
The output of this code would be 0 because the delete operator can't delete a local variable.

9, No value or 0 or undefined

10, No value or 0 or undefined

11, xyz

12, 

13, 5

14, 1, 1 xyz, 2, 1

15, undefined

16, no output

17, fuction foo is run time function while function bar is a parse time function.

18, it's a behaviour of moving declaration to the top the current of scoop.

19, Original salary was undefined
    My salary is 5000$
    
20, false

21, console.log(counterArray.lenght);
